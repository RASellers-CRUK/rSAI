r Spatial Annotation Interface:
Transferring annotations into and out of R from common XML/JSON-based polygons into rGEOS objects [all compatible with Seurat]; it's never been easier.

Here we offer an interface between imaging software such as HALO (Indica Labs) and QuPath; importing annotations into R and generating compatible annotations to go back to HALO/QuPath.
Provided is also a facility to generate polygon annotations from Visium SD data; support for Visium HD coming soon.
